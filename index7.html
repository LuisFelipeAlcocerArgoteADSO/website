    <p> The story narrates the life of Rodion Raskolnikov, a student in the capital of Imperial Russia, St. Petersburg, who is forced<br>
        to suspend his studies because of the misery in which he finds himself, despite the efforts of his mother Pulcheria and his<br>
        sister Dunia to send him money.<br><br>

        His sister, with the intention of helping him, accepts the marriage proposal of a rich man, which makes his brother angry when<br>
        he learns that she has accepted the proposal without having consulted him. But, although he does not want to accept the help,<br>
        Rodion has airs of grandeur, and in his delusions he believes he is worthy of a great future.<br><br>
        
        Raskolnikov decides to murder the old woman, not only with the aim of robbing her, in fact, he abandons her in a very lonely place<br>
        and does not make use of the loot that he quickly takes out of the moneylender's house after her murder, but also because he considers<br>
        her a human being useless to society. However, Raskolnikov's position is much more complex:<br><br>
        
        The crime leaves Rodion in a state of great confusion. For days, he is plunged into delirious fevers, caused by the act itself, wandering<br>
        aimlessly and losing track of reality at times, while at others he is terribly lucid. We are shown a mind as brilliant as it is disturbed,<br>
        obsessed by the act committed.<br><br>
        
        In his wanderings through St. Petersburg, Raskolnikov meets the former civil servant Marmeladov, a drinker who ends up dying, drunk, run<br>
        over by a horse; and his unfortunate family, whom Raskolnikov helps financially after Marmeladov's death, with the meager rubles he receives<br>
        from his mother. The eldest daughter of this family is Sonia, a very rebellious young girl who, in order to help her mother, prostitutes herself<br> 
        to help her stepmother and her brothers, will be the only person to whom Raskolnikov explicitly confesses his crime.<br><br>
