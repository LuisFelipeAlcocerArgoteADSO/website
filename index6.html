<p><b>Media and Information Literacy (MIL)</b> plays a significant role in enhancing <b>critical thinking skills.</b><br>
     Here are some ways it does so:<br>

    -Differentiating Facts and Opinions: MIL helps individuals distinguish between facts and opinions.<br>
    -Evaluating Data: It encourages individuals to always evaluate the data they come across.<br>
    -Fact-Checking: MIL promotes the habit of verifying the truthfulness of information through fact-checking.<br>
    -Using Credible Sources: It guides individuals to refer only to credible sources for information.<br>
    -Avoiding Single Source Dependency: MIL advises not to rely on a single source for information.<br><br>
    Research shows that media and information literacy improves critical thinking,<br>
    awareness of media bias, and the desire to consume quality news. It's also found<br>
    that there are connections between media literacy instruction and critical thinking skills.<br>
    Media literacy education is a tool for combating mis/disinformation in a time where there is so much uncertainty.<br>
    This education encourages readers to consider the use of these media literacy skills in educational and community<br>
    settings to help the public better understand how to manage various mediated environments3.</p>
