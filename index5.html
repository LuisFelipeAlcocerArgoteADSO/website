    <p>I am a person who has been developing the desire to learn a lot, therefore it has been<br>a virtue that has helped me to improve in different areas of my life.<br>At one time it was not that way but the mistakes have made<br>me grow and adapt to new changes in my academic and work life.
    </p>
Currently the world of programming has grown a lot so we new developers<br>must learn and adapt effectively to new technologies<br>which I like because it is a challenge for me.
<p></p>
I have always seen life with the feeling that everyone who passes<br>something we can learn and continue to the next station with more experience.
